\title{Use Expansion Rule to Simulate Ecological Diversification of a Biota.}
\usage{
expansion(nreps = 1, Sseed, Smax, ecospace, method = "Euclidean",
  strength = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{nreps}{Vector of integers (such as a sequence) specifying sample number
produced. Only used when function is applied within \code{lapply} or
related function. Default \code{nreps=1} or any other integer produces a
single sample.}

\item{Sseed}{Integer giving number of species (or other taxa) to use at start
of simulation.}

\item{Smax}{Maximum number of species (or other taxa) to include in
simulation.}

\item{ecospace}{An ecospace framework (functional trait space) of class
\code{ecospace}.}

\item{method}{Distance measure to use when calculating functional distances
between species. Default is \code{Euclidean} using
\code{stats::\link[stats]{dist}}. \code{Gower} or any other value uses
Gower distance (using \code{FD::\link[FD]{gowdis}}). Presence of factor or
ordered factor character types forces use of Gower distance.}

\item{strength}{Strength parameter controlling probability that expansion
  rule is followed during simulation. Values must range between
  \code{strength=1} (default, rules always implemented) and \code{strength=0}
  (rules never implemented).}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame with \code{Smax} rows (representing species) and
  as many columns as specified by number of characters/states (functional
  traits) in the ecospace framework. Columns will have the same data type
  (numeric, factor, ordered numeric, or ordered factor) as specified in the
  ecospace framework.
}
\description{
Implement Monte Carlo simulation of a biota undergoing ecological
diversification using the expansion rule.
}
\details{
Simulations are implemented as Monte Carlo processes in which
  species are added iteratively to assemblages, with all added species having
  their character states specified by the model rules, here the 'expansion'
  rule. Simulations begin with the seeding of \code{Sseed} number of species,
  chosen at random (with replacement) from either the species pool (if
  provided in the \code{weight.file} when building the ecospace framework
  using \code{create_ecospace}) or following the neutral-rule algorithm (if a
  pool is not provided). Once seeded, the simulations proceed iteratively
  (character-by-character, species-by-species) by following the appropriate
  algorithm, as explained below, until terminated at \code{Smax}.

  \strong{Expansion rule algorithm:}  Measure distances between all pairs of
  species, using \code{Euclidean} or \code{Gower} distance method specified
  by \code{method} argument. Identify species pair that is maximally distant.
  If multiple pairs are equally maximally distant, one pair is chosen at
  random. The newly added species has traits that are equal to or more
  extreme than those in this species pair, with probability of following the
  expansion rule determined by the \code{strength} parameter. Default
  \code{strength=1} always implements the rule, whereas \code{strength=0}
  never implements it (essentially making the simulation follow the
  \code{\link{neutral}} rule.)

  Each newly assigned character is compared with the ecospace framework
  (\code{ecospace}) to confirm that it is an allowed state combination before
  proceeding to the next character. If the newly built character is
  disallowed from the ecospace framework (i.e., because it has "dual
  absences" [0,0], has been excluded based on the species pool
  [\code{weight.file} in \code{create_ecospace}], or is not allowed by the
  ecospace \code{constraint} parameter), then the character-selection
  algorithm is repeated until an allowable character is selected. When
  simulations proceed to very large sample sizes (>100), this confirmatory
  process can require long computational times, and produce "new" species
  that are functionally identical to pre-existing species. This can occur,
  for example, when no life habits, or perhaps only one, exist that forms an
  allowable novelty between the selected neighbors.

  Expansion rules tend to produce ecospaces that progressively expand into
  more novel regions. Additional details on the expansion simulation are
  provided in Novack-Gottshall (In pressA, B), including sensitivity to
  ecospace framework (functional trait space) structure, recommendations for
  model selection, and basis in ecological and evolutionary theory.
}
\note{
A bug exists within \code{FD::\link[FD]{gowdis}} where nearest-neighbor
  distances can not be calculated when certain characters (especially numeric
  characters with values other than 0 and 1) share identical traits across
  species. The nature of the bug is under investigation, but the current
  implementation is reliable under most uses. If you run into problems
  because of this bug, a work-around is to manually change the function to
  call \code{cluster::\link[cluster]{daisy}} using \code{metric="gower"}
  instead.

  The function has been written to allow usage (using \code{\link{lapply}} or
  some other list-apply function) in 'embarrasingly parallel' implementations
  in a high-performance computing environment.
