\title{Use Redundancy Rule to Simulate Ecological Diversification of a Biota.}
\usage{
redundancy(nreps = 1, Sseed, Smax, ecospace, strength = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{nreps}{Vector of integers (such as a sequence) specifying sample number
produced. Only used when function is applied within \code{lapply} or
related function. Default \code{nreps = 1} or any other integer produces a
single sample.}

\item{Sseed}{Integer giving number of species (or other taxa) to use at start
of simulation.}

\item{Smax}{Maximum number of species (or other taxa) to include in
simulation.}

\item{ecospace}{An ecospace framework (functional trait space) of class
\code{ecospace}.}

\item{strength}{Strength parameter controlling probability that redundancy
rule is followed during simulation. Values must range between
\code{strength = 1} (default, rules always implemented) and \code{strength = 0}
(rules never implemented).}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame with \code{Smax} rows (representing species) and
  as many columns as specified by number of characters/states (functional
  traits) in the ecospace framework. Columns will have the same data type
  (numeric, factor, ordered numeric, or ordered factor) as specified in the
  ecospace framework.
}
\description{
Implement Monte Carlo simulation of a biota undergoing ecological
diversification using the redundancy rule.
}
\details{
Simulations are implemented as Monte Carlo processes in which
  species are added iteratively to assemblages, with all added species having
  their character states specified by the model rules, here the 'redundancy'
  rule. Simulations begin with the seeding of \code{Sseed} number of species,
  chosen at random (with replacement) from either the species pool (if
  provided in the \code{weight.file} when building the ecospace framework
  using \code{create_ecospace}) or following the neutral-rule algorithm (if a
  pool is not provided). Once seeded, the simulations proceed iteratively
  (character-by-character, species-by-species) by following the appropriate
  algorithm, as explained below, until terminated at \code{Smax}.

  \strong{Redundancy rule algorithm:} Pick one existing species at random and
  create a new species using that species' characters as a template. A
  character is modified (using a random multinomial draw from the ecospace
  framework) according to the \code{strength} parameter. Default
  \code{strength = 1} always implements the redundancy rule, whereas
  \code{strength = 0} never implements it (essentially making the simulation
  follow the \code{\link{neutral}} rule.) Because new character states can be
  any allowed by the ecospace framework, there is the possibility of
  obtaining redundancy greater than that specified by a strength parameter
  less than 1 (if, for example, the new randomly chosen character states are
  identical to those of the template species).

  Redundancy rules tend to produce ecospaces with discrete clusters of
  functionally similar species. Additional details on the redundancy
  simulation are provided in Novack-Gottshall (2016a,b), including
  sensitivity to ecospace framework (functional trait space) structure,
  recommendations for model selection, and basis in ecological and
  evolutionary theory.

\note{
The function has been written to allow usage (using
  \code{\link{lapply}} or some other list-apply function) in 'embarrassingly
  parallel' implementations in a high-performance computing environment.
